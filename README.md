# smart-urban-environment
To design and simulate an intelligent urban environment in Cisco Packet Tracer that integrates smart surveillance and intelligent street lighting, triggered automatically through sensor-based input to enhance city safety, efficiency, and energy management.
# Aim
To design and implement a smart city monitoring system using Cisco Packet Tracer that integrates intelligent street lighting and smart surveillance based on real-time sensor data and automation.
# Problem Statement
Urban environments face increasing challenges in energy efficiency, public safety, and infrastructure management. Traditional street lighting systems waste electricity by operating continuously, and conventional surveillance lacks automation. A smart system is needed to optimize resource usage and enhance security by utilizing IoT-enabled solutions.
# Scope of the Solution
- Automate street lights to switch ON/OFF based on ambient light and motion detection.
- Trigger surveillance cameras via motion sensors for enhanced security.
- Use wireless connectivity for communication between IoT devices.
- Monitor and control the system via a central IoT server.
- Simulation built entirely within Cisco Packet Tracer using IoT boards and devices.
